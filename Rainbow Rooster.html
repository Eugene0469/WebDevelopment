        <p>Rainbow rooster is a binary purpose, low input, multicolored chicken originated from India. Rainbow roosters
            were
            first bred by Indbro Research and Breeding Farms in Southern India. This was part of a food program by the
            Government of India.</p>
        <p>Rainbow roosters mature between 4 to 6 months. When managed as a layer, with commercial feeds, rainbow
            roosters
            will lay 160-180 eggs in 72 weeks (16 months). At the end of lay, the bird weight is about 3kgs. The average
            egg
            weight is 60 grams.</p>
        <p>When managed as meat birds, the rainbow rooster will attain the average weight of 2kgs in 8 weeks under
            commercial feeds. At 8 weeks, rainbow roosters meat birds will have consumed 4.9 kgs of feed.</p>
        <p>Under scavenging conditions, the rainbow roosterâ€™s maturity rate is a bit slower, with the bird achieving the
            weight of 1.3kgs in 9 weeks. The medium meat production for rainbow roosters is 3kgs for male rainbow
            roosters
            and 1.9 to 2.2 kgs for hens.</p>
        <p>According to Indbro, rainbow roosters can sustain free-range and backyard rearing conditions and their
            productivity is much higher than others.</p>

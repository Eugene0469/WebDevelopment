        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the <span>red junglefowl</span>, is a type of
            domesticated
            fowl. <span>Rooster</span> or <span>cock</span> is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be
            called a
            <span>cockerel</span>; a male that has been castrated is a <span>capon</span>. The adult female bird is
            called a
            <span>hen</span>.
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for
            special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
            BCE).<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup>
            Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less
            commonly,
            as pets.
        </p>
        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018,<sup>[3]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
            other
            bird.<sup>[4]</sup> There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and
            in
            language
            and literature.</P>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
            hen.<sup>[10][11]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Other terms are:
        <ul>
            <li>capon: castrated or neutered male chicken <sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-12">[a]</a></sup></li>
            <li>chick: young chicken<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li> chook /tʃʊk/: chicken (Australia, informal)<sup><a

            <li> cockerel: young male chicken less than a year old<sup>[14]</sup></li>
            <li> pullet: young female chicken less than a year old.<sup>[15]</sup> In the poultry industry, a pullet is
                a sexually
                immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.<sup>[16]</sup>
            </li>
            <li>yardbird: chicken (southern United States, dialectal)<sup>[17]</sup></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, a chicken was any young domesticated bird, and the species was called domestic fowl or
            fowl.<sup>[18]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).<sup>[19]</sup>

        <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Behaviour</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
            of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
            order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
            roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
            established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
            injury.<sup>[28]</sup> When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by
            clucking in
            a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens
            to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
        </p>
        <p>
            A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
            roosters.<sup>[29]</sup> However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their
            surroundings.
            Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning
            calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.<sup>[30]</sup>
        </p>
        <h4>Crowing</h4>
        <p>
            Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
            well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a
            rooster.<sup>[31]</sup>
        </p>
        <h4>Rooster crowing contests</h4>
        <p>
            Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands,
            Belgium,<sup>[32]</sup> the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with
            longcrowers.
            Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain
            time is measured.
        </p>

        <h4>Courtship</h4>

        <p>
            To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
            lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.<sup>[33]</sup> The dance triggers a response in the
            hen<sup>[33]</sup> and when she
            responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2. Male
            pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or
            running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet on hen's back. 7.
            Male tail bending (following successful copulation).<sup>[34]</sup>
